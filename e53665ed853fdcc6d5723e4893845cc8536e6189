But runs into kernel panic at {security,selinux}_file_permission for any file operation (e.g ls) and boot loops with same kernel panic.\n\nIf selinux is in enforcing mode, then \"adb remount\" runs into the kernel panic at {security,selinux}_inode_getattr. https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/kernel/common/+/1448816 does help and there is no kernel panic on \"adb remount\". \"adb sync\" works as well but db845c doesn\u0027t come up on next boot and runs into a boot loop https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/M8mhZBFxZS/. Fixing the overlayfs_file selinux denial in the log above didn\u0027t help and we run into boot loop again with \"Abort message: \u0027Check failed: serviceManager Could not retrieve ServiceManager\u0027\".",
