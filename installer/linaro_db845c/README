These instructions will help you flashing the prebuilt bootloader
and AOSP images(built from sources) on db845c.

To flash the bootloader using qdl tool and AOSP images, we start
with booting into recovery mode. Connect power while holding the
"USB" button (next to volume buttons and on top of USB-A ports),
then connect USB-C cable to boot into recovery.

Run the flash-all-aosp.sh script on your Host device to flash
bootloader and AOSP images using fastboot. It assumes that we
have already build db845c AOSP images locally, or are flashing
factory images.

$ ./flash-all-aosp.sh

Troubleshooting -->
Wait for qdl to tell you that it succeeded, otherwise try one more
time... Disconnect power and USB cable. On successful flashing, it
should get you to fastboot prompt on db845c and bootloader splash
screen on the HDMI output.
