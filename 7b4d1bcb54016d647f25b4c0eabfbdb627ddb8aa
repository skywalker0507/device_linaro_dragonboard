      "message": "Hey Caleb, thanks for the input on this! Thouh I\u0027m not sure I totally understand your proposal.\n\nWhile the out-\u003edevices value does help us understand what type of output system is asking for, it doesn\u0027t really help us map the output type to the actual snd card device/port. \n\nI\u0027m finding tinyalsa to be quite limiting in this way, as it seems to come from a perspective of \"you know what card/port you want to use - so lets enable that via static config\", where as in these more dynamic situations with multiple cards (which can initialize in different orders), we really need some better enumerate/query/probe methods, which tinyalsa doesn\u0027t seem to provide.\n\nI sort of wish there was a libsmallalsa that helped there :)\n\nSo this patch is sort of trying to still go with a static \"we know what we want\" config, but then have it try the next device if things fail. Still not ideal, but a touch more flexible than the static config.\n\nBut I do agree it would be nice to have something that allowed us to review the list of cards and query for attributes, which would let us match the requested out-\u003edevices value.\n\nSorry, this has gotten a bit long. Did your suggestion just sail over my head?",
