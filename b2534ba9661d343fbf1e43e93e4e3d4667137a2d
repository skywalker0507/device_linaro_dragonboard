      "message": "Potentially we could send `device/linaro/dragonboard/shared/graphics/swangle/*` (which is also effectively `device/google/cuttlefish/shared/angle` and `device/google/cuttlefish/shared/swiftshader`) to the upstream ANGLE and SwiftShader repos. Then, we can have here and Cuttlefish both just do\n\n```\n-include external/swiftshader/android/device/BoardConfig.mk\n-include external/swiftshader/android/device/BoardConfig.mk\n``` \n\nsimilar to how we just added the common sepolicy directory to `external/minigbm/cros_gralloc`.\n\nBut otherwise LGTM.",
