      "message": "Mostly because of LTS. Historically we have always started with android-mainline for new devices and switched over to the next LTS/ACK when available. But there is no hard rule on that and we can stick to `android-mainline` as well if anyone got a valid reasoning.\n\nAlso, we keep updating android-mainline prebuilts at fairly regular interval and user can continue using android-mainline by setting `TARGET_KERNEL_USE\u003dmainline` variable at the build time.",
