      "message": "It is still possible to build and smoke test static kernel images on DB845c (just verified v6.5-rc6) as long as you keep CONFIG_MODULES\u003dy. Otherwise CONFIG_BPF_JIT won\u0027t be enabled and bpfloader service will crash and reboot the device.\n\nIIRC we had this hook back when empty vendor_ramdisk.img were not allowed. I don\u0027t know if it is still allowed, but we have been using vendor_ramdisk.img to store and load a few of our firmware binaries early in the boot process, so empty vendor_ramdisk.img has not been a case with our Dragonboard builds for sometime anyway.",
