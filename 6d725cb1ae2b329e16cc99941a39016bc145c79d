Digging further it seems its due to the following sepolicy denial:\n\ntype\u003d1400 audit(1568849449.975:20): avc: denied { read } for comm\u003d\"RenderThread\" name\u003d\"dri\" dev\u003d\"tmpfs\" ino\u003d7674 scontext\u003du:r:untrusted_app_25:s0:c512,c768 tcontext\u003du:object_r:gpu_device:s0 tclass\u003ddir permissive\u003d0 app\u003dcom.android.deskclock\n\n\nAnd using setenforce permissive makes the crashes go away.\n\nI suspect some of the sepolicy cleanup done since the v3 of this patchset, something went missing here.",
