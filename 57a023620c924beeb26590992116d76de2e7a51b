      "message": "Hey Roman,\n  So yes, in trying to address some of the audio limitations I was hitting with enabling usb web-cam support, I realized we probably need a more significant rework. I do very much think a shared cross-device HAL would be a good idea (as forking yukawa here isn\u0027t ideal), and I know cuttlefish is getting unified with the goldfish/ranchu audio hal as well, so there was some question if we should migrate back to that.\n  \n  We\u0027ve got a card to track such a rework, and I\u0027ll add a note to evaluate a move to tinyhal, but that\u0027s all work todo. \n  https://linaro.atlassian.net/browse/AOSP-101\n  \n  Pushing this change is more of a short term solution to enable usb-webcams without breaking current audio output.",
