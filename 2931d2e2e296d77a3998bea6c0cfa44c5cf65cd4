I did not dig further. I\u0027ll check with the landing team if they already know the reason behind this bug/crash associated with this seemingly wrong kernel base address.",

It looks like we copied it over from db845c and it worked from ABL but U-boot is not happy with that address.\n\nApparently 0x80000000 maybe wrong for db845c as well, as I have been told.\n\nAtleast for sm8550-hdk right value should be 0x0 as I see in the downstream code https://git.codelinaro.org/clo/la/platform/vendor/qcom/kalama/-/blob/qcom-devices.lnx.13.0.r1-rel/BoardConfig.mk?ref_type\u003dheads#L168.\n\nI\u0027m marking it as WIP, while I look for answers.
