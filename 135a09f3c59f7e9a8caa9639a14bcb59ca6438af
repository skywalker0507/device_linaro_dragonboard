Ideally I would like GKI (Image.gz) and all common aarch64 kernel modules be part of boot.img and all the platform specific kernel modules (from db845_gki.fragment) to be in vendor_ramdisk. But for that we either need to do the kernel modules segregation in device/linaro/dragonboard-kernel project or maintain a list of vendor_ramdisk kernel modules and use the copy filter to track which kernel module goes where. I\u0027m too lazy to maintain any of the above cases unfortunately :(. So the easiest way out was to just copy all the kernel modules to either ramdisk.img or vendor_ramdisk.img. I\u0027m open for ideas and keen to learn how the other platforms are doing that.\n",
